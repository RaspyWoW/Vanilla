# RaspyWoW - Vanilla

Welcome to the new generation of interconnected WoW realms â€” all hosted on Raspberry PI.

Raspy WoW aims to create an efficient, cheap-to-run and self-sustainable suite for hosting multiple WoW expansions at once.<br>
Every board will share the same architecture and setup, providing an easy option for players to maintain their characters all the way from Vanilla to WotLK.
Raspy WoW will keep the realms up to date with frequent rollouts from the open source repositories of VMaNGOS, CMaNGOS, and AzerothCore.
